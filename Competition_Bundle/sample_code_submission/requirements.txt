# ============================================================================
# REQUIREMENTS.TXT - Python Dependencies for Model Submission
# ============================================================================
#
# This file lists all Python packages required by your model.py file.
# The competition ingestion program will automatically install these packages
# using: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# WHAT MUST PARTICIPANTS PROVIDE?
# --------------------------------
# Participants MUST provide a requirements.txt file if their model uses any
# external Python packages (beyond the standard library).
#
# WHAT IS OPTIONAL?
# -----------------
# - If your model only uses standard library (no external packages), you can
#   omit this file or leave it empty.
# - Version constraints (>=, ==, etc.) are optional but recommended for
#   reproducibility.
#
# WHAT CAN PARTICIPANTS CHANGE?
# ------------------------------
# Everything! Add any packages your model needs:
# - Deep learning: tensorflow, torch, keras, etc.
# - Machine learning: scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, etc.
# - Image processing: opencv-python, pillow, scikit-image, etc.
# - Utilities: pandas, tqdm, etc.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# ----------------
# - One package per line
# - Use standard pip format: package_name>=version
# - The competition environment has Python 3.9+ and common packages pre-installed
# - Large packages (like TensorFlow) may take time to install - be patient
# - If installation fails, check package names and versions
#
# ============================================================================
# BASELINE REQUIREMENTS (scikit-learn version)
# ============================================================================
# This baseline uses scikit-learn, so we need numpy and scikit-learn.
# Participants can modify this to include their own dependencies.

numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
