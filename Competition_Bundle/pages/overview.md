# Grain Variety Classification Challenge

Welcome to the **Grain Variety Classification Challenge**! This challenge is part of the "Creation of an AI Challenge" course at Université Paris-Saclay (2025-26).

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/LubinLgp/CreationAiChallenge_Group1/tree/main/

---

## Objective

Develop an AI model to **classify wheat grain varieties from images** (8 classes). This is a multi-class classification problem emphasizing **model generalization** across different conditions (microplots, dates, imaging setups).

**Key Challenge**: Your model must work well on grains from different conditions, not just training data.

- Unlimited submissions for testing
- Public leaderboard

### Final Evaluation Phase (March 16 - March 31, 2026)
- Limited submissions
- Final leaderboard determines winners

## How to Participate

1. **Register** on Codabench and join the competition
2. **Get the Starting Kit** (see Starting Kit page)
   - Download `README.ipynb` notebook
   - Review baseline model code
3. **Develop Your Model**
   - Improve the baseline (CNN, data augmentation, etc.)
   - Test locally before submitting
4. **Submit Your Solution**
   - Create `model.py` with Model class
   - Create `requirements.txt` with dependencies
   - Zip both files (must be at root of zip)
   - Upload on Codabench
5. **Iterate**: Analyze results and improve (unlimited submissions in development phase)

**Important**: Always test locally before submitting. See Starting Kit page for detailed submission format.

## Evaluation

**Primary Metric**: Accuracy (percentage of correctly classified grains)

Additional metrics (F1-Score, Cohen's Kappa) are computed for detailed analysis. See Evaluation page for details.
